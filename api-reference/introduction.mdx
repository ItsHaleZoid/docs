Welcome to the Asimov API reference. This documentation provides detailed information about all available endpoints accessible via API keys, request/response formats, and code examples.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://asimov.mov/api
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API keys. API keys start with `asmv-` and should be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Rate Limits

Asimov enforces usage limits based on your subscription tier:

- **Free Tier**: 550 searches/month, 1M tokens/month
- **Paid Tier**: 15,000 searches/month, 10M tokens/month

When limits are exceeded, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
