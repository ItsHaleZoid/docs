## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is Asimov?">
  Asimov is a foundational AI search platform that enables developers to build powerful semantic search capabilities for AI agents and applications. It provides vector-based semantic search, content management with automatic chunking and embedding, and usage tracking with tiered limits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get started with Asimov?">
  To get started with Asimov:
  1. Sign up at [asimov.mov/get-started](https://asimov.mov/get-started)
  2. Generate an API key from [Settings > API](https://asimov.mov/settings/api)
  3. Make your first API request using the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart)

  See our [Quickstart guide](/quickstart) for detailed instructions with code examples.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What authentication methods are supported?">
  Asimov API uses API key authentication. API keys start with `asmv-` and are used for all API requests. Use Bearer token authentication in the `Authorization` header.

  Generate your API key from [Settings > API](https://asimov.mov/settings/api) in the dashboard.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Content Management

<AccordionGroup>


<Accordion title="How does semantic search work?">
  Semantic search uses vector embeddings:
  1. Your query is converted to a vector embedding of 4096 dimenstions.
  2. Our infrastructure performs vector similarity search
  3. Results are reranked using the reranker model
  4. Optional parameter filtering is applied
  5. Top results are returned based on relevance
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are metadata parameters?">
  Parameters are custom metadata fields you create to organize and filter content. They allow you to:
  - Tag content with custom attributes (version, category, status, etc.)
  - Filter search results by specific parameters
  - Organize content for better retrieval

  Parameters must be created before they can be used in content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I search by specific document?">
  Yes! Use the `id` parameter in search requests to filter results by a specific document ID. This allows you to search within a single document rather than across all your content.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage & Limits

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What are the usage limits?">
  **Free Tier:**
  - 550 searches per month
  - 1 million tokens per month

  **Paid Tier:**
  - 15,000 searches per month
  - 10 million tokens per month

  Usage resets automatically on subscription renewal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I check my usage?">
  Check your [Dashboard](https://asimov.mov/dashboard) to see:
  - Current search usage vs limit
  - Current token usage vs limit
  - Whether limits are exceeded
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens when I exceed limits?">
  When you exceed usage limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with details about:
  - Which limit was exceeded (search or add)
  - Current usage vs limit
  - Message indicating upgrade options (for free tier)

  You can upgrade your plan to increase limits, or wait for the next billing cycle.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Getting 401 Unauthorized errors">
  Common causes:
  - Missing `Authorization` header
  - Invalid or expired API key
  - Incorrect header format (must be `Bearer <token>`)
  - API key not starting with `asmv-` prefix

  Generate a new API key from [Settings > API](https://asimov.mov/settings/api) if needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Getting 400 Bad Request errors">
  Common causes:
  - Missing required fields in request body
  - Invalid data types (e.g., string instead of object)
  - Using parameters that don't exist
  - Invalid parameter values

  Check the API reference for required fields and formats.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Search results are not relevant">
  Tips to improve relevance:
  - Use more specific queries
  - Utilize metadata parameters to filter results
  - Ensure your content is well-structured
  - Consider using the `recall` parameter to retrieve more candidates before filtering
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I delete old content?">
  Currently, content deletion is not available through the API. Contact support at [hamza@asimov.mov](mailto:hamza@asimov.mov) for assistance with content management.
