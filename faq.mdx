## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is Asimov?">
  Asimov is a platform that enhances your AI coding assistant by providing it additional tools for memory management, context storage, source indexing, and web search capabilities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get started with Asimov?">
  To get started with Asimov:
  1. Sign up at [Asimov](https://asimov.mov)
  2. Generate an API key from your settings
  3. Configure your AI assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf) with the MCP server
  4. Start using Asimov tools in your workflow

  See our [Quickstart guide](/quickstart) for detailed instructions.

## Context Management

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How does context storage work?">
  Context storage allows you to save conversation history with timestamps. This is useful for:
  - Sharing conversations between different coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc)
  - Continuing work across different sessions
</Accordion>


</AccordionGroup>

## Source Management

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What sources can I index?">
  You can index:
  - Documentation websites (e.g., framework docs, API references)
  - GitHub repositories (view structure and search code)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I index documentation?">
  Ask your assistant to index a documentation site:
  ```
  "Index the Supabase docs at https://supabase.com/docs" 
  or "Index Supabase docs"
  ```

  Once indexed, you can search the documentation without leaving your editor.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I view GitHub repository structure?">
  Yes! Use the repository view tool to see the file structure of any GitHub repository:
  ```
  "Show me the file structure of the socket.io GitHub repo"
  ```

  This helps your agent and you to understand the repository tree structure, before indexing it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can my agent read from specific repository file?">
  Yes! Use the repository select tool to read the content of a specific file in a repository:
  ```
  "Read the content of "Field" component from shadcn-ui/ui and implpement it with our OWN colorful branding."
  ```

  This helps your agent and you to understand the repository tree structure, before indexing it.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Web Search

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How does web search work?">
  Asimov's web search tool allows your AI assistant to find up-to-date information, documentation, and GitHub repositories in real-time. It's useful for:
  - Finding latest API versions
  - Discovering new libraries
  - Verifying documentation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What can I search for?">
  You can search for:
  - Documentation and tutorials
  - GitHub repositories
  - Code examples
  - Technical articles
  - API references
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="MCP server is not connecting">
  Common solutions:
  - Verify your API key is correct in the configuration
  - Restart your AI assistant after adding the configuration
  - Check that `npx` is available in your PATH
  - Ensure you have an active internet connection
  - Check the assistant's console/logs for error messages
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tools are not appearing in my assistant">
  If Asimov tools aren't showing up:
  1. Verify the configuration file is in the correct location:
     - Claude Code: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
     - Cursor: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
     - Windsurf: `~/Library/Application Support/Windsurf/mcp.json` (macOS)
     - Codex: `~/.codex/config.toml`
  2. Check the configuration syntax is correct (valid JSON for Claude/Cursor/Windsurf, valid TOML for Codex)
  3. Restart your assistant completely
  4. Check for error messages in the logs
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API key errors">
  If you're getting API key errors:
  - Generate a new API key from [asimov.mov/settings/api](https://asimov.mov/settings/api)
  - Update your MCP configuration with the new key
  - Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes in the API key
  - Restart your assistant after updating the configuration
</Accordion>
