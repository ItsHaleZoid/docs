## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is Asimov?">
  Asimov is a foundational AI search platform that enables developers to build powerful semantic search capabilities for AI agents and applications. It provides vector-based semantic search, content management with automatic chunking and embedding, and usage tracking with tiered limits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get started with Asimov?">
  To get started with Asimov:
  1. Sign up at [asimov.mov/get-started](https://asimov.mov/get-started)
  2. Generate an API key from [Settings > API](https://asimov.mov/settings/api)
  3. Make your first API request using the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart)

  See our [Quickstart guide](/quickstart) for detailed instructions with code examples.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to use API Key?">
  Asimov API uses API key authentication. API keys start with `asmv-` and are used for all API requests. Use Bearer token authentication in the `Authorization` header.

  Generate your API key from [Settings > API](https://asimov.mov/settings/api) in the dashboard.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Content Management

<AccordionGroup>


<Accordion title="How does search work?">
  Semantic search uses vector embeddings:
  1. Your query is converted to a vector embedding.
  2. Our infrastructure performs vector similarity search
  3. Results are reranked using the reranker model.
  4. Optional parameter filtering is applied (if given)
  5. Top results are returned based on relevance
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are metadata parameters?">
  Parameters are custom metadata fields you create to organize and filter content. They allow you to:
  - Tag content with custom attributes (version, category, status, etc.)
  - Filter search results by specific parameters
  - Organize content for better retrieval

  Parameters must be created before they can be used in content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I search by specific document?">
  Yes! Use the `id` parameter in search requests to filter results by a specific document ID. This allows you to search within a single document rather than across all your content.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage & Limits

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What are the usage limits?">
  **Free Tier:**
  - 550 searches per month
  - 1 million tokens per month

  **Paid Tier:**
  - 15,000 searches per month
  - 10 million tokens per month

  Usage resets automatically on subscription renewal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I check my usage?">
  Check your [Dashboard](https://asimov.mov/dashboard) to see:
  - Current search usage vs limit
  - Current token usage vs limit
  - Whether limits are exceeded
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens when I exceed limits?">
  When you exceed usage limits, you'll receive a `429` response with details about:
  - Which limit was exceeded (search or add)
  - Current usage vs limit
  - Message indicating upgrade options (for free tier)

  You can upgrade your plan to increase limits, or wait for the next billing cycle.

  Common causes:
  - Missing `Authorization` header
  - Invalid or expired API key
  - Incorrect header format (must be `Bearer <token>`)
  - API key not starting with `asmv-` prefix

  Generate a new API key from [Settings > API](https://asimov.mov/settings/api) if needed.
</Accordion>

  Common causes:
  - Missing required fields in request body
  - Invalid data types (e.g., string instead of object)
