## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is Asimov?">
  Asimov is a platform that enhances your AI coding assistant by providing it additional tools for memory management, context storage, source indexing, and web search capabilities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get started with Asimov?">
  To get started with Asimov:
  1. Sign up at [Asimov](https://asimov.mov)
  2. Generate an API key from your settings
  3. Configure your AI assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf) with the MCP server
  4. Start using Asimov tools in your workflow

  See our [Quickstart guide](/quickstart) for detailed instructions.

## Memory Management

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What can I store in memories?">
  You can store:
  - Almost anything that you think would help your code assistant in future to make better decisions.
  - You can instruct your code assistant to store them, when a specific type of scenario has happened.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I search my memories?">
  Simply ask your AI assistant to search for relevant information. For example:
  - "Search memories for authentication patterns"
  - "Find previous decisions about database schema"
    The assistant will automatically use Asimov's search tool to retrieve relevant memories.
  - "You can also see and manage all your memories collectivey in [Memories](https://asimov.mov/dashboard/memories).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I update existing memories?">
  Yes! When requirements change or you need to update information, ask your assistant to update the memory. The system will find the relevant memory and update it with new information.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Context Management

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How does context storage work?">
  Context storage allows you to save conversation history with timestamps. This is useful for:
  - Sharing conversations between different coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc)
  - Continuing work across different sessions
</Accordion>


</AccordionGroup>

## Source Management

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What sources can I index?">
  You can index:
  - Documentation websites (e.g., framework docs, API references)
  - GitHub repositories (view structure and search code)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I index documentation?">
  Ask your assistant to index a documentation site:
  ```
  "Index the Supabase docs at https://supabase.com/docs" 
  or "Index Supabase docs"
  ```

  Once indexed, you can search the documentation without leaving your editor.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I view GitHub repository structure?">
  Yes! Use the packages view tool to see the file structure of any GitHub repository:
  ```
  "Show me the file structure of the socket.io GitHub repo"
  ```

  This helps your agent and you to understand the repository tree structure, before indexing it.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Web Search

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How does web search work?">
  Asimov's web search tool allows your AI assistant to find up-to-date information, documentation, and GitHub repositories in real-time. It's useful for:
  - Finding latest API versions
  - Discovering new libraries
  - Verifying documentation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What can I search for?">
  You can search for:
  - Documentation and tutorials
  - GitHub repositories
  - Code examples
  - Technical articles
  - API references
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Billing & Usage

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How does Asimov pricing work?">
  Asimov offers flexible pricing based on your usage needs. Visit our [pricing page](https://asimov.mov/pricing) for detailed information about plans and features.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="MCP server is not connecting">
  Common solutions:
  - Verify your API key is correct in the configuration
  - Restart your AI assistant after adding the configuration
  - Check that `npx` is available in your PATH
  - Ensure you have an active internet connection
  - Check the assistant's console/logs for error messages
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tools are not appearing in my assistant">
  If Asimov tools aren't showing up:
  1. Verify the configuration file is in the correct location:
     - Claude Code: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
     - Cursor: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
     - Windsurf: `~/Library/Application Support/Windsurf/mcp.json` (macOS)
     - Codex: `~/.codex/config.toml`
  2. Check the configuration syntax is correct (valid JSON for Claude/Cursor/Windsurf, valid TOML for Codex)
  3. Restart your assistant completely
  4. Check for error messages in the logs
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API key errors">
  If you're getting API key errors:
  - Generate a new API key from [asimov.mov/settings/api](https://asimov.mov/settings/api)
  - Update your MCP configuration with the new key
  - Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes in the API key
  - Restart your assistant after updating the configuration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Search results are not relevant">
  To get better search results:
  - Be more specific in your queries
  - Use technical terms and keywords
  - Include context about what you're looking for
  - Try rephrasing your question
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Codex-specific issues">
  If you're using Codex and experiencing issues:
  - Ensure the config file is valid TOML format (not JSON)
  - Check that environment variables are properly formatted: `env = { "KEY" = "value" }`
  - Verify the Codex CLI is up to date: `codex --version`
  - Use `codex mcp list` to verify the server is properly configured
  - Check startup logs with increased verbosity if available
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
