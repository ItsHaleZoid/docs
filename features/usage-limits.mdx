Asimov provides tiered usage limits based on your subscription plan. Usage is tracked per user and resets automatically on subscription renewal.

## Subscription Tiers

### Free Tier

- **Search Limit**: 550 queries per month
- **Add Limit**: 1 million tokens per month

### Paid Tier

- **Search Limit**: 15,000 queries per month  
- **Add Limit**: 10 million tokens per month

## Checking Usage

Use the `GET /usage/status` endpoint to check your current usage:

```bash
curl -X GET https://asimov.mov/api/usage/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "usage": {
    "hasAccess": false,
    "searchUsage": 123,
    "addUsage": 450000,
    "searchLimit": 550,
    "addLimit": 1000000,
    "searchExceeded": false,
    "addExceeded": false
  }
}
```

## Usage Tracking

### Search Usage

- Each successful search request increments the search counter by 1
- Usage is checked before processing each search request
- If the limit is exceeded, you'll receive a `429` error

### Add Usage

- Token count is calculated using `tiktoken` (or estimated as content length / 4)
- Usage is checked before processing content addition
- If adding the content would exceed the limit, you'll receive a `429` error

## Rate Limit Errors

When you exceed usage limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:
