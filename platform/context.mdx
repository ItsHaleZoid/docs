## Overview

Context allows you to store conversation history and share it between different AI agents. This enables seamless collaboration where one AI agent can pick up where another left off, maintaining continuity across your workflow.

## 1. Add Context

Tell your agent to use `asimov-mcp` to add previous conversations to the context.

### Example Request

```text User Prompt
All the jargon we've done, add it to context using asimov-mcp.
```

### Response

```json API Response
{
  "success": true,
  "content": "1. User: I think therefore I am.\n2. 
  AI: Nope, I THINK, therefore I AM. Keep Thinking.\n3. 
  User: No, Think Different.",
  "message": "Context added successfully"
}
```

<Tip>
The context system stores the raw conversation content, allowing you to retrieve it later when switching between AI agents or sessions.
</Tip>

## 2. Search/Get Context

Retrieves the latest stored contexts with a `limit` parameter to control how many results to show.

### Example Request

```text User Prompt
Get the latest 5 contexts we've stored using asimov-mcp.
```

### Response

```json AI Agent

Sure! Let me do it...

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Found 3 context(s)",
  "content": "1. Date: 2025-10-14T10:00:00.000Z\n   Content: User: I think therefore I am.\n   
  Created: 2025-10-13T20:18:04.115Z\n\n2.
   Date: 2025-10-14T09:30:00.000Z\n   Content: AI:  Nope, I THINK, therefore I AM. Keep Thinking.\n   
   Created: 2025-10-13T19:45:00.000Z\n\n3. 
   Date: 2025-10-14T09:00:00.000Z\n   Content: User: No, Think Different.\n   
   Created: 2025-10-13T19:20:00.000Z"
}

Quite a strange context for programming...
```

## Use Cases

### Cross-Agent Collaboration

```text Scenario
You're working with Claude Code to build a feature, then switch to Cursor
to test it. Both agents can access the same context about what was discussed
and implemented.
```

### Session Continuity

```text Scenario
Start a conversation in the morning about architecture decisions, then
resume in the afternoon with full context of what was discussed earlier.
```

## â€¢ Difference from Memory


| Feature | Context | Memory |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Purpose | Store raw conversations | Extract and store facts |
| Processing | No processing, stored as-is | AI extracts key information |
| Use Case | Session continuity | Long-term preferences |
| Retrieval | Date-ordered list | Semantic search |
| Content | Full conversation snippets | Atomic facts |

<Info>
Use **Context** for maintaining conversation flow across sessions, and **Memory** for storing long-term facts and preferences.
