## 1. Store

You can ask your agent to store the important points to memory and the MCP would autmoatically choose, which is relevent or not.

#### Example
```json User Prompt
Add the previous point to memory and save it using asimov-mcp.
```

#### Response
```json AI Agent

Absolutely, let me do it.

  {
    "success": true,
    "results": [
      {
        "memory": "Prefers using TypeScript with strict mode enabled for 
        all projects",
      },
      {
        "memory": "Likes using Tailwind CSS for styling",
      },
      {
        "memory": "Uses Next.js 14 with the App Router",
      }
    ],
    "message": "Stored 3 memory items"
  }

```


## 2. Search

You can add instructions in `CLAUDE.md` (for Claude Code), `.cursor/rules.md` (For Cursor) or `.windsurfrules.md` (For Windsurf) to retrieve and search for memories that are related to your query, either occasionaly or on important moments.

#### Example
```json User Prompt
I think we've done the implementation of @dropdown.tsx 
before in another project, can we use that?
```

#### Response

```json AI Agent

*Searches for memories*

  Absolutely we can use it! Here it is:

```

## 3. Update

If a new thing happens and it contradicts or imples an update on the previously stored `memory`, then it can be instrctued to "update" that specific memory for up-to-date retrieval.

#### Example
```json User Prompt
Alright, Now that we've updated the dropdown.tsx, 
update the memory using asimov-mcp, so we stay up-to-date!
```

#### Response

```json AI Agent

You're definitely right! Let me update it!
